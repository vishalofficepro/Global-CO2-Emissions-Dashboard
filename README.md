# Global CO2 Emissions Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project showcases an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes 250 years of global CO2 emissions data (1750-2021). It aims to provide insights into how CO2 emissions have evolved over time, highlighting major contributing regions and countries, and the impact of industrialization on global emissions.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau**: For creating the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data preparation and cleaning.
- **Tableau Maps**: For visualizing geographical distributions of CO2 emissions.

## Key Insights
- **Historical Emissions**: There has been a dramatic increase in global CO2 emissions since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, with emissions peaking in recent decades.
- **Top Emitting Countries**: The dashboard reveals that countries like the United States, China, and India have been the top contributors to global CO2 emissions.
- **Per Capita Emissions**: Developed nations tend to have higher per capita emissions, while some developing countries with large populations contribute significantly due to industrial activities.
- **Impact of Policies**: Some countries show a flattening or reduction in emissions due to environmental policies and renewable energy adoption.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The data for this project was sourced from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io), which compiled CO2 emissions data from multiple reputable databases.
- **Time Span**: The dataset covers global CO2 emissions from 1750 to 2021, with country-specific and global aggregations.

## Visualizations
The Tableau dashboard includes:
- **Global Emissions Over Time**: A line chart showing the increase in CO2 emissions since 1750.
- **Country-Level CO2 Emissions**: A map visualizing CO2 emissions by country.
- **CO2 Emissions by Region**: A bar chart comparing emissions across different regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia).
- **Scatter Plot of Emissions vs. Population**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between a country's population size and its CO2 emissions.
  
## How to Use
1. Open the Tableau dashboard via the link provided in the repository.
2. Interact with the filters and visualizations to explore emissions trends by country, region, and over time.
3. Use the map to visualize the global distribution of emissions.

## Conclusion
The **Global CO2 Emissions Dashboard** provides a comprehensive view of global CO2 emissions trends over the past 250 years. It highlights the significant impact industrialization has had on emissions and points to the need for global policy and renewable energy solutions to address climate change.
